# React Hackathon

For todays hackathon we are going to practice extracting relevant information from resources that are solving the same problem but in a different way.

We will be making noughts and crosses - react style!

To have stateful components in react before hooks were invented you had to write a class component.

Your task today is to apply what you've learnt about react whilst following [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Extract what you need and use your knowledge of modern react to inform how you write your components.

Happy hacking!
